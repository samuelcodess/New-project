                Chelsea FC was founded on March 10, 1905, at The Rising Sun pub in Fulham, London. The club was the brainchild of Gus Mears, who acquired the Stamford Bridge Athletics Ground and sought to establish a football club to utilize the venue. Despite financial challenges in its early years, the club managed to join the Football League in 1905 and made its presence felt in English football.

                Chelsea experienced sporadic success in its early years, including an FA Cup win in 1970 and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumphs in 1971 and 1998. However, it was under the ownership of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in 2003 that the club's fortunes changed dramatically. The influx of significant financial investment allowed Chelsea to compete at the highest level and attract some of the world's best football talents.

                    Despite domestic dominance, European success remained elusive for Chelsea until 2012. Under the stewardship of interim manager Roberto Di Matteo, the Blues achieved their long-awaited dream of lifting the UEFA Champions League trophy. The final, held at the Allianz Arena in Munich, saw Chelsea defeat Bayern Munich in a dramatic penalty shootout. The victory marked a defining moment in the club's history and elevated Chelsea to the elite ranks of European football.
